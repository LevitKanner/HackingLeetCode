# Code Explanation ([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/))
1. `var i = 0;`: This line initializes a variable `i` with the value 0. This variable will be used to track the index of the character from the start of the string.

2. `var j = s.Length - 1;`: This line initializes a variable `j` with the value of the length of the string `s` minus 1. This variable will be used to track the index of the character from the end of the string.

3. `var lowercased = s.ToLower();`: This line creates a new string `lowercased` that contains all the characters of the original string `s`, but converted to lowercase. This ensures that case differences are ignored when comparing characters.

4. `while (i < j)`: This line starts a while loop that continues executing the following code block as long as the value of `i` is less than the value of `j`. The loop checks characters from both the start and end of the string and moves towards the center.

5. Inside the loop:
    - `if (!char.IsLetterOrDigit(lowercased[i]))`: This condition checks if the character at index `i` in the `lowercased` string is not a letter or digit. If true, it means the character is a non-alphanumeric character (e.g., space, punctuation), and `i` is incremented to move to the next character.
    - `if (!char.IsLetterOrDigit(lowercased[j]))`: This condition checks if the character at index `j` in the `lowercased` string is not a letter or digit. If true, it means the character is a non-alphanumeric character, and `j` is decremented to move to the previous character.

6. If both `i` and `j` point to alphanumeric characters, the code proceeds to compare them:
    - `if (lowercased[i] != lowercased[j])`: This condition checks if the character at index `i` and the character at index `j` in the `lowercased` string are not the same, even when case is ignored. If true, it means the characters are different, and the function returns `false`, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.

7. After the comparisons, the loop increments `i` and decrements `j`, effectively moving the comparison towards the center of the string.

8. Finally, after the loop ends, if all the corresponding characters from the start and end of the string have been successfully compared and found to be the same, the function returns `true`, indicating that the string is a palindrome when considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring case differences.

In summary, we check if a given string is a palindrome by comparing its alphanumeric characters while ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case differences. It uses two pointers (`i` and `j`) to traverse the string from the start and end simultaneously and performs character comparisons.
