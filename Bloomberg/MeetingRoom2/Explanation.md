# Code Explanation ([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/))

```csharp
int[] ends = new int[intervals.Length], starts = new int[intervals.Length];
```

- This line declares two integer arrays, `ends` and `starts`, both of which have the same length as the `intervals`
  array. These arrays will be used to store the start and end points of the intervals.

```csharp
for (var i = 0; i < intervals.Length; i++)
{
    starts[i] = intervals[i][0];
    ends[i] = intervals[i][1];
}
```

- This loop iterates through the `intervals` array. For each interval, it extracts the start point (at index 0) and end
  point (at index 1) and stores them in the respective arrays `starts` and `ends`. This step is preparing the data for
  sorting.

```csharp
Array.Sort(starts);
Array.Sort(ends);
```

- After extracting the start and end points, the code sorts both arrays in ascending order. Sorting is necessary for the
  subsequent comparison of intervals.

```csharp
var result = 0;
var e = 0;
foreach (var start in starts)
{
    if (start < ends[e])
    {
        result++;
    }
    else
    {
        e++;
    }
}
```

- Here, two variables are declared: `result` and `e`. `result` will store the count of overlapping intervals, and `e`
  will be used as an index for the `ends` array.

- The code enters a `foreach` loop to iterate through the sorted `starts` array. For each start point, it compares it
  with the corresponding end point (at index `e` in the `ends` array). If the start point is less than the end point, it
  means there's an overlap, so `result` is incremented to count it. Otherwise, if the start point is greater than or
  equal to the end point, it means no overlap, so the `e` index is incremented to consider the next end point.

- After iterating through all the intervals, `result` will contain the count of overlapping intervals, and it is
  returned as the result of the algorithm.
