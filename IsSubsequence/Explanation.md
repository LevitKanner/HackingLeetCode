# Code Explanation ([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence))

```csharp
if (s.Length > t.Length) return false;
```
- First, we check if the length of the string `s` is greater than the length of the string `t`.
- If `s` is longer than `t`, we return `false` immediately.
- This is because if `s` has more characters than `t`, it can't be formed by deleting characters from `t`.

```csharp
if (s == t || s == "") return true;
```
- Next, we check if `s` is equal to `t` or if `s` is an empty string.
- If `s` is exactly the same as `t` or if `s` is an empty string, we return `true` immediately.
- This is because if `s` is equal to `t`, no deletions are needed, and if `s` is an empty string, no deletions are needed either.

```csharp
var sequences = 0;
```
- We create a variable called `sequences` and set it to 0. This variable will count how many characters in `t` match the characters in `s` in order.

```csharp
foreach (var character in t)
{
    if (sequences < s.Length && s[sequences] == character)
    {
        sequences++;
    }
}
```
- We enter a loop that goes through each character in the string `t`.
- Inside the loop, we check two conditions:
    - If `sequences` is less than the length of `s`. This makes sure that we don't go beyond the length of `s`.
    - If the character in `t` at the current position matches the character in `s` at the position indicated by `sequences`.
- If both conditions are met, we increment the `sequences` variable.
- This loop essentially counts how many characters in `t` match the characters in `s` consecutively from the beginning of both strings.

```csharp
return sequences == s.Length;
```
- After the loop, we check if the `sequences` count is equal to the length of `s`.
- If `sequences` equals the length of `s`, it means all characters in `s` appear consecutively in `t` in the same order.
- In this case, we return `true` because `s` can be formed by deleting characters from `t`.
- If `sequences` is not equal to the length of `s`, it means not all characters in `s` appear consecutively in `t`, so we return `false`.
