# Explanation of code ([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/))

```csharp
if (s.Length != t.Length) return false;
```
- This line checks if the lengths of strings `s` and `t` are equal. If they are not equal, it means that the strings can't be anagrams of each other, and the function returns `false`.

```csharp
if (s == t) return true;
```
- This line compares the strings `s` and `t`. If they are equal, it means that they are already anagrams of each other (since they have the same characters in the same order), and the function immediately returns `true`.

```csharp
Dictionary<char, int> sLetterCount = new();
Dictionary<char, int> tLetterCount = new();
```
- These lines declare two dictionaries `sLetterCount` and `tLetterCount`. These dictionaries will be used to store the frequency/count of each character in strings `s` and `t` respectively.

```csharp
for (var i = 0; i < s.Length; i++)
{
    if (sLetterCount.ContainsKey(s[i]))
    {
        sLetterCount[s[i]] += 1;
    }
    else
    {
        sLetterCount[s[i]] = 1;
    }

    if (tLetterCount.ContainsKey(t[i]))
    {
        tLetterCount[t[i]] += 1;
    }
    else
    {
        tLetterCount[t[i]] = 1;
    }
}
```
- This loop iterates through the characters of both strings `s` and `t` using the index `i`.
    - For each character `s[i]` in string `s`, it checks if `sLetterCount` dictionary contains the character as a key. If it does, it increments the count for that character. If not, it initializes the count to 1 for that character.
    - Similarly, for each character `t[i]` in string `t`, it updates the count in the `tLetterCount` dictionary.

```csharp
return !sLetterCount.Any(
    entry => !tLetterCount.ContainsKey(entry.Key) || tLetterCount[entry.Key] != entry.Value);
```
- This line uses the LINQ `Any` method to iterate through the entries in the `sLetterCount` dictionary.
    - For each entry, it checks whether the corresponding character exists in the `tLetterCount` dictionary. If not, or if the counts don't match, it means that the characters' frequencies are not the same in both strings, making them not anagrams. In this case, it would return `false`.
    - If all entries have corresponding characters with matching counts in `tLetterCount`, it means the strings are anagrams, and it would return `true`.
